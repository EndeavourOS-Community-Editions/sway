EndeavourOS Sway-WM CheatSheet : 

- Hello! Welcome to EndeavourOS and our Sway-WM Edition! Now we'll admit this is not vanilla Sway and it wasn't desinged to be. It is loosely themed around the ArcDark
colorscheme chosen for it's stability and ease of implementation. The default bar is Waybar not Swaybar - once again chosen it's ease of use and stability as well 
the options it offers. 

- Sway is documentated through man pages unlike i3.To get a overview of what to expect you can read 'man 5 sway'. The pages are then spilt into topics - some the 
important ones are listed at the bottom of the document. Waybar is also documented through man pages - 'man 5 waybar'. 

- Our file structure is spilt for easier use - the names of the files eg; 'output' referring to the part they play. 

- If your experiencing issus with your cursor - edit file '~/.profile' and comment out 'export WLR_NO_HARDWARE_CURSORS=1'

- Other than that enjoy your time here and welcome! You can join the Forum or our Telegram - we'd love to hear from you!
