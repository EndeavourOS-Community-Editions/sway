# EndeavourOS Sway Edition Cheatsheet

- Hello and welcome to EndeavourOS Sway Edition! We'll admit this is not
  vanilla Sway and it isn't desinged to be. It's loosely themed around the
  ArcDark colorscheme chosen for stability and ease of implementation. The
  default bar is Waybar, not Swaybar -- once again chosen for ease of use,
  stability and the options it offers.

- Sway is documented through man pages -- unlike i3. To get a overview of what
  to expect, read 'man 5 sway'. The pages are spilt into topics. Some of the
  important ones are listed at the bottom of the document. Waybar is also
  documented through man pages, see 'man 5 waybar'.

- Our file structure is split for easier use. The names of the files (e.g.
  'output') refer to the part they play.

- If you experience issues with your cursor, edit '~/.profile' and comment out
  'export WLR_NO_HARDWARE_CURSORS=1'

- We hope you enjoy your time with it. Again, welcome to EndeavorOS Sway
  Edition and make sure you join the Forum or our Telegram. We'd love to hear
  from you!
